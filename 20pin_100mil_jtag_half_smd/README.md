This adapter connects a Black Magic Probe (aka ARM Cortex Debug connector) to a
legacy 20Pin ARM connector. This design uses an SMD 10Pin ARM Cortex Debug
connector and SMD tact reset switch. We retain the 20Pin connector as a through
hole part as this is more flexible and allows the use of male and female
connectors.
