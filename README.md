1BitSquared adapter collection
==============================

This repository contains a collection of various adapter board designs created
by Piotr Esden-Tempski and 1BitSquared.

All the designs are available under the Creative Commons V4.0 By Attribution
Share Alike license.

You are welcome to take the designs and order your own boards or order them
prebuilt from [1BitSquared US](http://1bitsquared.com) or [1BitSquared
Germany/EU](http://1bitsquared.de). Each adapter board README file should
contain a link to an OSHPark order link. You can then easily order the boards
in multiples of 3 with free international shipping. :)

If you have some additional adapters or modify the published desings and you
would like to share with us and the community through this collection please do
not hesitate to send us a pull request. The only hard requirement is that the
designs are done in KiCad. Thank you for your support!

Please DO NOT use the adapter designs to create your own retail products. You
are not helping __anyone__ besides your own pocket by making "cheap copies". We
are sharing those designs to be helpful to the community not for you to make a
quick buck. :D

If you are interested in bulk pricing to resell the adapters through your own
shop please contact: info@1bitsquared.com we do provide good bulk pricing for
anyone who wants to carry our products.
